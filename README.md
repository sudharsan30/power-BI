# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of road accidents, including casualties, accident severity, and trends. The aim is to help stakeholders understand the factors contributing to road accidents and identify areas for improvement.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Analyze and visualize road accident data for 2021 and 2022.
- Provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents.
- Help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to reduce road accidents.



 includes detailed records of road accidents, including:
- Date and time of the accident
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Weather conditions
- Road conditions
- Types of vehicles involved
- Number of casualties
- Accident severity

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs
1. **Total Casualties and Total Accidents**:
   - Current year values.
   - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.

2. **Total Casualties by Accident Severity**:
   - Current year values.
   - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.

### Secondary KPIs
1. **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type**:
   - Current year values.

2. **Monthly Trend**:
   - Comparison of casualties for the current year and the previous year.

3. **Casualties by Road Type**:
   - Current year values.

4. **Current Year Casualties**:
   - By area/location.
   - By day/night.

5. **Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location**:
   - Current year values.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following Power BI visualizations:

1. **Total Casualties and Accidents**:
   - A KPI card showing current year values and YoY growth.

2. **Casualties by Accident Severity**:
   - A KPI card showing current year values and YoY growth.

3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**:
   - A bar chart showing the distribution of casualties by vehicle type for the current year.

4. **Monthly Trend**:
   - A line chart comparing monthly casualties for the current year and the previous year.

5. **Casualties by Road Type**:
   - A bar chart showing the distribution of casualties by road type for the current year.

6. **Total Casualties and Accidents by Location**:
   - A map visualization highlighting the number of casualties and accidents by location for the current year.

## Insights

From the analysis, several insights can be drawn, such as:
- Peak periods and locations for road accidents.
- The impact of different vehicle types and road types on casualties.
- Monthly trends in road accidents and casualties.
- Differences in casualties during day and night.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Python/SQL**: For data cleaning and preprocessing (if applicable).

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure the dataset is clean and formatted correctly.
   - Load the dataset into Power BI.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Open Power BI and import the dataset.
   - Create the visualizations as per the KPIs and insights required.
   - Use filters and slicers to interact with the data and gain deeper insights.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the visualizations to derive meaningful insights.
   - Use the insights to propose recommendations for reducing road accidents.
